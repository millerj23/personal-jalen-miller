Hello, I'm Jalen Miller!  I'm a current student at Georgetown College graduating on November 30th!


## Early Life

I was born and raised in southern Ohio where I was able to fruitfully learn the ways of hard work and success. Through living in a small, tight community, I was able to make small town connections that would lead me to pursue a scholarship at Georgetown College while competeing for the baseball team. I have always had major interest in sports and electronics so playing baseball and being able to ocomplete a minor in computer science has been a dream come true. 

## Studies

I started out my college career at Morehead State Unviersity where I studied Electronics Engineering. Along with working towards this degree, I competed for the baseball and football teams at MSU. Through some hard thinking and decision making, I found that I wanted to shift my studies to economics with a minor in computer science. 

After deciding this was my goal, I transferred to Georgetown College to complete these task. With this being my third year of studying at GC, I have had a phenomenal experience and learned a plethora. My intention is to graduate in December as I have a job lined up in Lexington, Kentucky pertaining to product management. 


## Incorporating Computer Science

As I have a job lined up for after I graduate in December, I am currently co-opping with this company now. Through spending all summer and these past few months with this company, I have gotten to see how this type of work plays part in my role as a product manager. As I have dove deep into my role, I now understand the depths of computer science, data science, and data analytics in the safety and security world. My comapny specializes in the safe lock industry (SAL) where we produce the most secure safe lock in the world. To make this happen, there is tons of coding and programming to create these locks to perfection. 

## My Future

Looking down the road, I have many goals I want to accomplish. My main goal however, is that I would love to complete a masters in computer science. This would assist me in the data analytics world immensly. This will be a decision for me in the coming years but I feel it will be important in learning everything I can and being the best data scientist possible.
